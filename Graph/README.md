# Graph

**WHY are graphs important?**

Graphs are important because they are a powerful way to represent and analyze relationships between objects. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

* **Social networks:** Graphs can be used to represent the relationships between people in a social network. This can be used to analyze how information spreads through the network, or to identify the most influential people in the network.
* **Transportation networks:** Graphs can be used to represent the relationships between different parts of a transportation network, such as roads, railways, and airports. This can be used to optimize routes, or to identify bottlenecks in the network.
* **Computer networks:** Graphs can be used to represent the relationships between different computers in a network. This can be used to route traffic, or to detect and prevent network attacks.

**WHAT is a graph?**

A graph is a mathematical structure that consists of two sets:

* **Vertices:** The vertices of a graph are the objects that we are interested in representing.
* **Edges:** The edges of a graph represent the relationships between the vertices.

An edge can be either directed or undirected. A directed edge has a direction, which means that it goes from one vertex to another. An undirected edge does not have a direction, which means that it goes from one vertex to another and back again.

**HOW do we represent graphs?**

There are two main ways to represent graphs:

* **Adjacency matrix:** An adjacency matrix is a table that shows whether or not there is an edge between each pair of vertices.
* **Adjacency list:** An adjacency list is a list of vertices, where each vertex is associated with a list of its neighbors.

The following is an example of an adjacency matrix for a graph with 4 vertices:

```
0 1 2 3
1 0 1 0
2 1 0 1
3 0 1 0
```

The following is an example of an adjacency list for a graph with 4 vertices:

```
0: 1, 2
1: 0, 2
2: 0, 1, 3
3: 1, 2
```
