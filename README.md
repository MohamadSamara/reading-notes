## Summary 1: Relational Databases and SQL

Relational databases and SQL are integral components of modern data management systems, enabling efficient organization and retrieval of structured data. The following points highlight key aspects of relational databases and SQL:

### Relational Databases:

A relational database consists of tables with rows and columns, representing entities and attributes, respectively.

### SQL (Structured Query Language):

SQL is a language for interacting with relational databases.

It supports various operations, including data retrieval (SELECT), data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and data definition (CREATE, ALTER, DROP).

SQL queries allow users to retrieve specific data based on criteria and join data from multiple tables.

### Common SQL Queries:

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables based on specified conditions.

INSERT: Adds new records into a table.

UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.

DELETE: Removes records from a table.

WHERE: Filters data based on specific criteria.

GROUP BY: Groups data for aggregate functions, facilitating data summarization.

ORDER BY: Sorts query results based on specified columns.

JOIN: Combines data from multiple tables based on related columns.

Relational databases and SQL play a critical role in managing data efficiently, ensuring data consistency, and supporting complex data operations. Their widespread adoption across industries underscores their importance in modern data-driven environments.
