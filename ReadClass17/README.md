## In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application

OAuth is a standard that allows applications to access resources hosted by other applications on behalf of a user. This means that you can log in to a website or app using your credentials from another website or app, without having to create a new account or share your password.

For example, you can use OAuth to log in to your GitHub account using your Google credentials. This means that you don't have to create a separate Spotify account, and you don't have to give Spotify your Facebook password.

OAuth is used by a wide variety of websites and apps, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, Spotify, and GitHub. It is a secure and convenient way to log in to multiple websites and apps without having to create and remember multiple passwords.
