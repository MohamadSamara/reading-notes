## Name a few examples of real world ManyToMany relationships

* A student can take many classes, and a class can have many students.
* A product can have many categories, and a category can have many products.
* A user can be a member of many groups, and a group can have many members.
* A post can have many tags, and a tag can be used in many posts.

## Explain the significance of a join table for ManyToMany relationships and What are the values held within a join table?

**Join tables** are used to represent many-to-many relationships in a database. A join table has two columns, one for each of the two tables in the relationship. The values in the join table are the foreign keys that reference the primary keys of the two tables.

For example, consider the following many-to-many relationship between students and classes:

```
Student:
- id (primary key)
- name

Class:
- id (primary key)
- name
```

To represent this relationship in a database, we would create a join table called `StudentClass`:

```
StudentClass:
- student_id (foreign key to Student table)
- class_id (foreign key to Class table)
```

The values in the `StudentClass` table would be the IDs of the students and classes that are related. For example, the following row in the `StudentClass` table would indicate that student 1 is taking class 2:

```
StudentClass:
- student_id = 1
- class_id = 2
```

Join tables are significant because they allow us to store the many-to-many relationships between tables in a database. Without join tables, we would have to store the relationships in one of the two tables, which would be inefficient and difficult to maintain.
